## Overview
<p style="background:#F7F7F7; padding:10px; border-radius:5px;">
MVCTrack is an enhanced framework for **3D single object tracking (3D SOT)** in point clouds, designed to address the limitations of sparse and incomplete LiDAR data. Our approach introduces a **Multimodal-guided Virtual Cues Projection (MVCP)** scheme to enrich sparse point clouds by integrating RGB camera data, significantly improving tracking performance, particularly in scenarios with distant or small objects.

This repository provides the code for **MVCTrack**, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **NuScenes dataset**.

## Key Features
### **Multimodal-guided Virtual Cues Projection (MVCP)**
A novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play scheme that:
1. Utilizes **2D object detection** to generate virtual cues from RGB images.
2. Projects dense 2D semantic information into **3D space** to balance point cloud density.
3. Enhances the **sparsity and completeness** of point clouds.

### **MVCTrack Framework**
An end-to-end 3D SOT tracker that:
1. Seamlessly integrates the MVCP scheme to improve tracking accuracy.
2. Effectively balances point density distribution across different distances.
3. Achieves competitive performance with minimal computational overhead.

### **State-of-the-Art Performance**
- Evaluated on the large-scale **NuScenes dataset**.
- Significantly surpasses existing multi-modal 3D trackers.
- Demonstrates exceptional performance in sparse and occluded scenarios.
